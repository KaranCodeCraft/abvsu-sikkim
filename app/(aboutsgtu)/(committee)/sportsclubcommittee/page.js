              The Sports Club Committee at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Skill University (ABVSU) plays a vital role in promoting sports, physical fitness, and overall well-being among students. The committee is dedicated to fostering a spirit of teamwork, competition, and healthy living through a wide range of sports activities and events. By encouraging participation in various sports, the committee aims to develop not only athletic skills but also life skills such as discipline, leadership, and perseverance.

              One of the primary objectives of the Sports Club Committee is to organize and manage inter-college and intra-college sports events. These events include tournaments, matches, and competitions across multiple sports such as cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, and athletics. The committee ensures that all events are well-coordinated, providing the necessary facilities, equipment, and support to participants. By hosting these competitions, the committee not only promotes a culture of sportsmanship but also brings together students from diverse backgrounds, fostering camaraderie and community spirit.

            <p>
              In addition to competitive sports, the committee also emphasizes the importance of recreational activities. Regular sports meetups, fitness sessions, and workshops are organized to encourage students to engage in physical activity for leisure and health benefits. These activities provide an opportunity for students to unwind, relieve stress, and maintain a balanced lifestyle amidst their academic commitments.
